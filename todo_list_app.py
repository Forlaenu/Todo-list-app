# In this exercise you are going to create a Todo List App. 
# Create a new folder and initialize it as a git repository. 
# Connect the repository up to github and make sure you commit and 
# push your changes as you work through the solution.

# Features:
# When the app starts it should present user with the following menu:

# Press 1 to add task
# Press 2 to delete task
# Press 3 to view all tasks
# Press q to quit
# : 
# The user should only be allowed to quit when they press 'q'.

# Add Task:
# Ask the user for the 'title' and 'priority' of the task. Priority can be high, medium and low. Make sure you validate this.

# Delete Task:
# Show user all the tasks along with the index number of each task. User can then enter the index number of the task to delete the task.

# View all tasks:
# Allow the user to view all the tasks in the following format:

# 1 - Wash the car - high
# 2 - Mow the lawn - low

# Implementation Suggestions
# Store each task in a dictionary and use 'title' and 'priority' as keys of the dictionary.

# Store each dictionary inside an array. Array will represent list of tasks.
